## Rules to be followed  while modifying  this property files
## (1)Do not define variables with same ie check if it already exists .  
## (2)Do not define variables with Control_ as suffix as the are Control variables
## (3)Use suffixes describing the variable place where it is used eg varibles in 
##    in Wiki module begin with suffix Wiki.
## (4)Do not add template variables that have only grammar prepositions in them 
##    eg $Notice_in=in , at, for etc should not be used .
##    This is because we get incorrect  meanings in languages other than  English.
##    e.g in English subject comes before object
##    eg "Christine looked in the mirror".In this example, "Christine" is the subject because
##    the sentence asserts that she looked in the mirror, but in Hindi object comes before subject.
## (5)Please make use of complete statements instead of breaking them into parts
##    ,please note that your english statements are to be translated in other languages which have different
##    GRAMMAR rules .
## (6)Make sure that atleast name of buttons  should have  one variable to define them eg Button "Save Original Page"
##    should not be written as $Save $Original $Page ,but must be written as $a="Save Original Page"
## (7)Javascript messages have to be hardcoded in English
## (8) RESTRICTED VARIABLES in *.vm files
##	  (01) $generator
##        (02) $outputDirectory
##        (03) $strings
##        (04) $files
##        (05) $properties
##        (06) $velocityCount
